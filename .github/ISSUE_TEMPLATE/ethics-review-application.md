E.	Informed Consent Process
1.	Investigators are required to obtain informed consent from all participants before they become involved in the study. Use the guidelines found at twu.ca/research/research-services/research-ethics/guidelines-informed-consent.
A copy of the consent form should be left with the participant (does not require signatures).
(a)	Informed consent from parents or guardians is required when research participants are less than the age of majority (the exception is underage university students, who are assumed to be capable of consenting for themselves), or incapable of giving fully informed consent (e.g. persons with cognitive impairments). Where consent is provided by a parent or guardian, assent should also be obtained from the research participant to the extent possible.
The age of majority varies depending on the province where you will be conducting your research. It is:
18 years of age in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan;
19 years of age in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, and Yukon.
Please indicate who will consent to your study:
 Research participant	 Parent/Guardian
 (b)	Will consent be in written form? (Note: Consent is ordinarily to be obtained in written form unless there is justifiable reason for oral consent.)
 Yes	 No
If no, explain why oral consent is preferred and how consent will be recorded. Justification must be given as to why oral consent needs to be used instead of written consent.
     
(c)	Describe the process that will be followed to obtain informed consent (and assent, if applicable) and attach all related documents (e.g. letter of information, screening materials, consent form, script for oral consent and/or assent).
     
(d)	If participants are screened out of or choose not to participate in the study, will they have access to the information they provided to you?
 Yes	 No
If yes, describe the process and conditions under which the information will be made available.
